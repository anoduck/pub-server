# pub-server

**pub-server**, or **pub** for short is an HTML generator+editor entirely written in javascript.

For users with node.js, pub-server provides a simple command-line utility which can render an HTML website from markdown in any directory. The generated output uses npm-installable themes and is fully customizable.

The generator+editor can also run in-browser, allowing non-technical users to edit and instantly preview the generated HTML, without first installing pub-server themselves.

To see this in action, check out the docs at http://jldec.github.io/pub-doc/. The editor appears when you click on the [edit](http://jldec.github.io/pub-doc/pub/?page=%2F) button at the top right.
Feel free to play around - in this instance, your changes will not be recorded.

Other examples include a [presentation theme](https://github.com/jldec/pub-sample-deck), a [flexbox design](https://github.com/jldec/pub-theme-brief), and a [blog](http://blog.pubblz.com/)

## installation

using **pub-server** requires node.js or io.js.

``` bash
npm install -g pub-server
```

OSX and Linux are working, Windows support is coming - PRs welcome.


## usage

- `pub` (with no options) serves `*.md` in the current directory or looks for a `pub-config.js`. The default theme is useful for previewing GitHub README.md files like this one. The server will watch for changes and update http://localhost:3001/ whenever markdown files or CSS or other static files are saved.

- `pub -O` generates .html and other static files (including generator + editor) to `./out`.

- `pub -S <dir>` serves static files from any directory. It will mimic the behavior of GitHub Pages, looking for index.html files in folders, and redirecting from /folder-name to /folder-name/

- `pub -h` shows the usage info below:

```

  -S, --static-only <dir>  serve only static files from <dir>
  -m, --md-fragments       use markdown headers as fragments
