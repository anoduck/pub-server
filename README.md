## pub-server

**pub-server**, or **pub** for short, is a web publishing tool built with node and express.

**pub** generates html from markdown files.

Start by using **pub** to preview your github README or other markdown files. Simply run `pub` from the command line in your project folder. It will:

- find all the markdown files there
- render them in your browser at http://localhost:3001/
- watch the files for changes
- automatically refresh your browser when you save a change from your favorite editor

Later you may want to use **pub** for documentation, a blog, or a website with a theme of your choice.


### installation

**pub** requires node.js or io.js.

``` bash
npm install -g pub-server
```

Windows support is coming - PRs welcome.

### editor with instant preview

**pub-editor** was designed for self-service editing online.

You can also use it to edit your markdown when pub is running locally.

- click on `Edit` at the top right
- this prepends `/pub` to the url which opens the page in the editor
- adjust the split between the panes by dragging the separator at the top
- edit the markdown on the left, and see the result instantly in the preview on the right
- **NOTE: your changes will be saved immediately, overwriting the file**
- use git to validate the changes before committing
