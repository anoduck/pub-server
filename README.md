## pub-server

**pub-server**, or **pub** for short is an HTML generator+editor entirely written in javascript.

The generator+editor runs in-browser, allowing non-technical users to edit their markdown _source_ text fragments, and instantly preview the generated HTML, without first installing pub-server themselves.

When you publish onto a static hosting service like [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/), you can include the generator+editor together with the published HTML.

To see this in action, check out the docs at http://jldec.github.io/pub-doc/. The editor appears when you click on the [edit](http://jldec.github.io/pub-doc/pub/?page=%2F) button at the top right. Feel free to play around - in this instance, your changes will not be recorded. For a different example with a [presentation theme](https://github.com/jldec/pub-sample-deck), see [here](http://jldec.github.io/roadmap/pub/?page=%2Fde%2F%3Ffull%23fragment-1).

_NOTE: This editor will be much improved, including wysiwig markdown features, once [marijnh](https://github.com/marijnh/) releases [ProseMirror](https://github.com/ProseMirror/prosemirror). Please support him [here](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/prosemirror/#/story)._

### installation

using **pub-server** requires node.js or io.js.

``` bash
npm install -g pub-server
```

OSX and Linux are working, Windows support is coming - PRs welcome.


### usage

- `pub` (with no options) serves `*.md` in the current directory or looks for a `pub-config.js`. The default theme is useful for previewing README.md files like this one.

- `pub -O` generates .html and other static files (including generator + editor) to `./out`.

- `pub -S <dir>` serves static files from any directory. It will mimic the behavior of Github Pages, looking for index.html files in folders, and redirecting from /folder-name to /folder-name/

- `pub -h` shows the usage info below:
